SimpleBank Contract (Easy Explanation)

This contract works like a very basic online bank where users can deposit and withdraw Ether.


---

1. balances mapping

mapping(address => uint256) private balances;

Stores each user’s balance.

Example:
balances[userAddress] = 5 ETH



---

2. Deposit and Withdraw Events

These are used to log actions on the blockchain:

event Deposit(...)
event Withdraw(...)

They help track who deposited or withdrew money.


---

3. constructor() payable

constructor() payable { ... }

Runs only once during deployment.

Allows the deployer to send Ether during contract creation.

If Ether is sent, it is added to their balance.



---

4. deposit()

function deposit() public payable

Anyone can send Ether to the contract.

msg.value = amount of Ether sent.

The amount is added to the sender’s balance.

Emits a Deposit event.


Simple idea:
User → sends Ether → contract stores it → user’s balance increases.


---

5. withdraw(amountWei)

function withdraw(uint256 amountWei) public

User requests to withdraw a certain amount.

Checks:

1. Amount > 0


2. User has enough balance



Deducts from their stored balance.

Sends Ether back to the user.

Emits a Withdraw event.


Simple idea:
User → takes money out → contract sends Ether back.


---

6. getBalanceWei()

function getBalanceWei() public view returns (uint256)

Shows the balance of the person calling the function.

Purely read-only.
