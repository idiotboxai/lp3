⭐ Explanation of the Bank Smart Contract

The program defines a smart contract named Bank in Solidity.
This contract allows a user (the owner) to deposit, withdraw, and check their Ether balance.

The contract stores two important variables:

balance → a private unsigned integer storing the Ether balance of the owner inside the contract

accOwner → the Ethereum address of the account owner

The constructor is payable and sets the deployer as the account owner.

When the contract is deployed, the deployer becomes accOwner.

Any Ether sent during deployment (msg.value) is stored as the initial balance.

The deposit() function is payable, which means it can receive Ether.

When the user calls deposit() and sends Ether with the transaction,
that Ether (msg.value) is added to balance.

The withdraw() function allows only the owner to withdraw Ether.

Uses require() to ensure:
a) Only the owner can withdraw
b) The amount must be greater than zero
c) The balance must be enough

If all conditions are true:

The amount is subtracted from internal balance

Ether is transferred to the owner using transfer()

The showBalance() function returns the owner’s balance.

It is a view function, meaning it only reads from the blockchain.

The contract also has receive() and fallback() functions.

Both are payable

Both increase the balance when Ether is sent directly to the contract
